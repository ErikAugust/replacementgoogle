# Replacement Google

Replacement Google was a NFL / Google spoof site that received over 1.1 million pageviews in under 72 hours. It received all sorts of media attention - and was featured on [NPR](https://eaj-media.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/replacement-google-npr.png), [HuffPost](https://eaj-media.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/replacement-google-huff-post.png), [CBS News](https://eaj-media.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/replacement-google-cbs-news.png), CNBC, BuzzFeed, ABC News, among many others. Google even tweeted about it from their official account.

An ESPN Radio article describes Replacement Google well:

> It's replacementgoogle.com, an obvious spoof on Google's popular search engine, that pokes fun at the NFL's officiating situation in a truly hilarious and original way.
The way the site works is simple. You just type in what you want to search, hit search, and watch as replacement Google fetches you your search results. However, just like the NFL's replacement officials, there is no guarantee that what the search engine returns is going to be correct, no matter how blatantly obvious and it is that you typed in what you were looking for correctly. For example, I just wanted to look up a recipe for hummus, and got back a search for "movies without Shaq in them."

The original Replacement Google was written in PHP. For the 12th anniversary of Replacement Google, I decided to rewrite it as an Express application using TypeScript.

Pull requests are welcome!

Cheers,
